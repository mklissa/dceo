The code is for training SAC from pixels with `dm_control`, as described in
"Improving sample efficiency in model-free reinforcement learning from images"
(Yarats, Zhang, Kostrikov, Amos, Pineau, & Fergus, 2019):
https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01741

In order to run this you first need to install `dm_control`. The instructions
for this are given
[here](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/blob/420e2373d11681f9d78513b16db2ac8b5eb99381/README.md).
