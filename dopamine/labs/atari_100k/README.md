#### Labs: Atari 100k
This directory provides code for running experiments on the [Atari 100k][simple]
benchmark where agents are evaluated after training only for 100k environment
steps (400k frames of interaction).

* To get started, we release JAX implementations of following agents:
 * [DER][der] (Data Efficient Rainbow)
 * [OTRainbow][otr] (Over-trained Rainbow)
 * [DrQ][drq] and [DrQ(Îµ)][drl_precipice] (Data-regularized Q)

All of these agents are based on the [full rainbow][full_rainbow] agent in Dopamine
and can be instantiated using the gin configs provided in this directory. For
evaluation, we report scores averaged over 100 episodes after training.
For more details about evaluation protocols, refer to the [rliable library](https://github.com/google-research/rliable).

The entry point to the Atari 100k experiments is
[`dopamine/labs/atari_100k/train.py`](https://github.com/google/dopamine/blob/master/dopamine/labs/atari_100k/train.py).
To run the `DER` agent,

```
python -um dopamine.labs.atari_100k.train \
  --base_dir /tmp/dopamine_runs \
  --gin_files dopamine/labs/atari_100k/configs/DER.gin
```
